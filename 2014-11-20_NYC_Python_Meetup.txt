	Strongest feature is MVC.

	Back end: 
		Postgres
		MySQL
		SQLite

		HTML 
		JSON

			Using Django to generate JSON is a pretty simple matter.

	Mindblowing features of Django

		Django Geo feature

	Django brings organization, which gives you a path for expansion.

Lightning talk 1: ?: pip freeze

Lightning talk 2: Marcus: MIT App Inventor 2.


Eric Schles: Flask

	Developer evangelist for Syncano. 
	Prof at NYU. 

	Three months of Syncao access

	Three free months of Syncano: Codes is Pythonsync. 


	Flask: "Build your views first and let that inform what you're doing."

	Eric creates computational tools to fight slavery. 

	URL mapping is easy. 

	Don't name an app "app". Name collisions!

	Server is either a computer that serves up files, or an application that's served.

	Downsides to Flask:

		Does not scale perfectly (ie, code can get messy).

		Just writing functions instead of classes for views can get ugly. 

			Jon Banafato: Class does have class-based views. 

Lightning talk 3: James Powell: Rewriting the interpreter.
